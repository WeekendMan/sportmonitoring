<p>Dear friends,</p>

<p>As big fans of cycling, for many years we were watching all the related broadcastings. It is amazing how the races presentation has changed in recent times – nowadays it is full of visual information illustrated the road-map, race favorites, and their telemetry, etc. This information is interesting and important, but not unique; it is more or less easy reachable by most of the companies.<br>At the same time, big social data offers you an exclusive content reflecting spectators’ opinions about teams, racers, favorites and their chances, race routes, bikes and features, etc. in a real-time format. Content, generated by users of social networks, is an important source of information, which could be effectively used to illustrate the most interesting moments of the race with viewers’ sentiments as well to fill the boring pauses when nothing is happening on the route. In addition, it could attract new spectators involving them to own tweet-competition.</p>
<p>Taking into account the fact that all the teams, all the commentators have Twitter accounts, and most of the spectators are active Twitter users, you can imagine the amount of content posted and reposted during 5-6 race hours.</p>
<p>Such thoughts have brought us to the idea of Sports Monitoring application, which could accumulate and process Social Media Data in a real-time regime. This dashboard consists of four informational parts:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A list of the most popular tweets
    <ol type="a">
      <li>of the last 15 min</li>
      <li>of the last hour</li>
      <li>of the day</li>
      <li>of the race</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>A table of the most popular racers and the sentiments, they caused
    <ol type="a">
      <li>the most mentioned racers of the last 15 min and the sentiments, they caused</li>
      <li>the most mentioned racers of the stage and the sentiments, they caused</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>A graph of racers’ popularity and the sentiments over the time (coming soon)</li>
  <li>The  recent tweets posted by organizers, teams, and favorite commentators.</li>
</ol>

<p>In addition, you can choose any race from the schedule and see some general information about previous races (top tweets and the most mentioned racers with the sentiments, they caused).</p>
<p>If you find this idea interesting, please, let us know. We are looking for partners to develop the project further. We are going to add localizations for different languages, the most-discussed topics, users’ geography, etc. We are also opened for your ideas how to improve the Sports Monitoring application for your requests.</p>
<p>Sincerely yours,<br>SportMonitoring team</p>
